= Getting AsciiDoc Blocks

.`Get AsciiDoc Blocks`:
[arachne, ruby]
----
def getAdocBlocks(toTangle)
  adocBlocks = []

  for arg in toTangle

== Checks

These are mostly checks to see if the inputs to the program are valid.

.For downtangling, these valid input formats are:
* `<AsciiDoc File Path>`
* `<AsciiDoc File Path>:<Arache Block Name>`

Pretty self-explanatory, these checks will be run before the blocks in a document are found.

.`Preblock Checks`:
[arachne, ruby]
----
if File.file?(arg)
  toTangle += [arg]
  next
end

filePath = arg
if not filePath.include?(":")
  warn("arachne [WARNING]: could not find file \"" + arg + "\"")
  next
else
  filePath = arg[/^.+(?=:)/]
end

if not File.file?(filePath)
  warn("arachne [WARNING]: could not find file \"" + filePath + "\" in argument \"" + arg + "\"")
  next
end
----

Also self-explanatory, these checks will be run after all the blocks in a document are found.

.`Postblock Checks`:
[arachne, ruby]
----
inpBlock = arg[/(?<=:).+$/]
puts inpBlock

# TODO - check if block is found in file
